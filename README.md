## Inspiration

Bindle became an idea after we (The Bindle Team) were sharing stories of traveling, exploring, and hanging out with new exciting people. If you ever find yourself about in a new town, on your own, and are down to meet other people who just want to share laughs and adventures with other travelers, this is the app for you.
